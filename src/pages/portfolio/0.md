# Modern interpretation of the Mediterranean or Spanish style

The Spanish twist on this Long Beach home demonstrates a harmonious blend of classic Mediterranean architecture with contemporary finesse. The stucco finish, terracotta roof tiles, and graceful archways echo the timeless charm of Spanish design, while the modern landscaping and elegant dark wood garage and window frames introduce a sleek, current-day appeal.

#### During Renovations

When planning for this home, the homeowners knew what style they wanted and how they wanted it, we drew up the plans by hand, ran them by the homeowners and they loved it.
The plans included 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with a large open living area as soon as you enter the home.
And of course a beautiful fancy oven and stove with beautiful marbled cabinets and a two car garage.
